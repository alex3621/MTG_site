        <h2>History of the Game</h2>
        <h3 class="info">
            Magic The Gathering is a collectible trading card game that was created by mathematician Richard Garfield 
            and published by Wizards of the Coast back in 1993. It quickly blew up around the world ever since its inception and has 
            since become one of the most popular games even up till this day. It contains rich stories, characters, interesting background,
            vivid world-building, and much more than just a plain old card game.
            <br><br>
            The origins of Magic the Gathering traces bcak to the 1990s, when Richard Garfield was 
            approached by Peter Adkison, the founder of Wizards of the Coast, to create a new game. 
            Garfield has had success as a game designer previously, so he accepted the challenge. 
            What insued was a card game that enables players to build a deck from a pool of cards.
            <br><br>
            The first set of Magic The Gathering cards was released in 1993 and it was an instant success.
            Players loved the creativity that goes into playing and deck-building along with interesting lore and characters to go along with it. 
            As the game grew in popularity, Wizards adopted the style of releasing expansion sets on a regular basis, even up until today!

        <h2>Official rules</h2>
        <h3 class="info">
            Magic the Gathering currently has multiple formats, meaning that the same cards can be used under different rule sets. Which is another 
            reason why it became so popular. The most popular formats include: Standard, Modern, Commander, Pioneer, and Pauper. I will quickly go over
            the rule sets for standard as it is the official <b>"tournament"</b> format.
