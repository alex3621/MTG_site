        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>
            My name is Alex Lin and I am a second year CPA student at Seneca. My favorite sport is table tennis and I used to play for the
            UofT team. My favorite food includes: sushi, ramen, fried chicken, bbq, and steak!
            <br><br>
            I chose Magic the Gathering as my favorite game because this is the game that connects me to my highschool friends even until this day.
            Most of my friends from high school have not been in contact with me, but the occasional game of Magic the Gathering between a group of 
            my friends still keeps us close. It is more than just a game but rather a "gathering" just like it says in the name, the act of getting
            together and having fun is the main focus. In addition, the game supports a lot of formats which means it can be played with 2,3,4, and even
            more players if we wanted to!
